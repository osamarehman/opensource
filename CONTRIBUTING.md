### Enterprise Standards
- **Scalability:** Solutions must handle enterprise-scale workloads
- **Reliability:** Include error handling, retries, and monitoring
- **Security:** Follow security best practices (encryption, validation)
- **Observability:** Add logging, metrics, and health checks
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive docs for deployment and usage

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% test coverage for new code
- **Documentation:** All public functions must have docstrings
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling with meaningful messages
- **Configuration:** Externalize all configuration (no hardcoded values)
- **Monitoring:** Include metrics and health check endpoints

## 🎯 Code Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Example Code Structure
```python
"""
Module for handling RFP opportunity processing.
Provides enterprise-grade opportunity management with ML scoring.
"""
import asyncio
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@dataclass
class OpportunityProcessor:
    """Processes RFP opportunities with enterprise features."""

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, any]):
        """Initialize processor with configuration."""
        self.config = config
        self.session_id = self._generate_session_id()

    async def process_opportunities(
        self,
        opportunities: List[RFPOpportunity]
    ) -> Dict[str, int]:
        """
        Process a batch of RFP opportunities.

        Args:
            opportunities: List of opportunities to process

        Returns:
            Dict containing processing statistics

        Raises:
            ProcessingError: If critical processing failure occurs
        """
        try:
            # Implementation here
            pass
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Processing failed: {e}")
            raise ProcessingError(f"Failed to process opportunities: {e}")
```

### Configuration Management
- Use YAML or JSON for configuration files
- Support environment variable overrides
- Include validation and default values
- Document all configuration options

### Error Handling Patterns
```python
# Good: Specific exception handling with logging
try:
    result = await risky_operation()
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
    # Handle gracefully or raise with context
    raise ProcessingError(f"Failed to complete operation: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}", exc_info=True)
    # Don't suppress unexpected errors
    raise
```
