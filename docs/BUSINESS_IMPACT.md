## üí∞ ROI Calculation Framework

### Standard ROI Metrics
```
Time Savings Value = (Hours Saved per Week √ó Hourly Rate √ó 52 weeks)
Process Efficiency Gain = (Throughput Increase √ó Revenue per Unit)
Error Reduction Value = (Error Rate Reduction √ó Cost per Error √ó Volume)
Capacity Increase Value = (Additional Capacity √ó Revenue per Unit)

Total Annual Benefit = Time Savings + Efficiency Gains + Error Reduction + Capacity Increase
ROI % = ((Total Annual Benefit - Implementation Cost) / Implementation Cost) √ó 100
```

### Example Calculation
**Client:** Mid-size consulting firm
**Implementation Cost:** $15,000
**Annual Benefits:**
- Time Savings: $120,000 (20 hours/week √ó $50/hour √ó 52 weeks)
- Capacity Increase: $180,000 (3x client capacity at $5K average)
- Error Reduction: $24,000 (reduced rework and client issues)
- **Total Annual Benefit:** $324,000
- **ROI:** ((324,000 - 15,000) / 15,000) √ó 100 = **2,060%**
